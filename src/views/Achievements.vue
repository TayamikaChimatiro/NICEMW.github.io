              <strong>Main achievements</strong>
              <br />
              <br />Since its inception, NICE has reached tens of thousands of people with civic and voter education messages, provided high quality election monitoring, and was highly successful in remaining relevant to the needs of its beneficiaries, the Malawian population.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>More specifically the project was able to:</strong>
              <br />
              <br />Establish over 30 resource centres which provide information and civic education in a continuous manner. Each month these resource centres are visited by an average of 50, 000 persons. In addition to this, the resource centres are used as meeting points for several partner organizations, networks and associations.
              Facilitate the establishment of over 100 community-owned and –managed rural libraries. In addition to being a continuous source for learning and information these structures also serve as meeting points for communities, committees and adult literacy classes.
              <ul>
                  <li>Successfully mobilize communities to become active and take the initiative to work towards improving their standard of life. This is evidenced by the numerous self-help committees, clubs and CBOs that were facilitated with the help of NICE staff and volunteers.</li>
                  <li>Promote political tolerance among members of different political parties e.g. through the formation of multiparty committees in several districts.</li>
                  <li>Successfully mobilise voters and delivering voter education during the 1999, 2004 and 2009 Parliamentary and Presidential elections.</li>
                  <li>Promote common good orientation and volunteerism throughout its work</li>
                  <li>A number of successful achievements were not initially intended by the designers of the project, but came about by the specific manner NICE approached its work. Although not initially planned for they are in no way less important:</li>
                  <li> NICE managed to establish a country-wide structure that is an envy of both the governmental and non-governmental sector. With three regional offices, 29 district offices, 200 Area Civic Educators and 6000 trained volunteers NICE has an impressive and very efficient implementation structure in place that can be used by other partners to carry out activities.</li>
                  <li>NICE is successfully challenging the hegemony of the allowance syndrome with its own “goat culture” approach. The project has been commended by many organizations who are now also trying to emulate and implement this positive example set by NICE.</li>
                  <li>NICE is strengthening the work of the district assemblies by sitting on Assembly sub-committees, sharing work plans and budgets with the assembly on a monthly basis or planning and implementing joint activities.</li>
              </ul> 
              <br><br>

              <b>Financial Capability:</b><br><br> 
              Besides the great goodwill from donors and government, NICE generates its own resources through provision of civic education related services that have benefit to the general public. In this regard NICE has at least MK40 million in its own resource generated account. Donor and Government Money are solely used for the intended purposes.  NICE is not profit making but uses own resources to build its sustainability mechanisms but also reinvests the resources into programs that benefits the people. In total 2016/17 our working budget is MK4, 349, 647, 378 (USD8, 495,404.96).

              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Project Name:</b>Civic & Voter Elections for the General Elections (1999, 2004, 2009), and Tripartite Elections (2014);
              <br />
              <b>Description & Scope:</b>NICE conducted and and co-ordinated civic and voter education activities as evidenced in its participation in these processes for the 1999, 2004 and 2009 Parliamentary and Presidential Elections; as well as 2014 Tripartite Elections. NICE’s contribution to civic and voter education campaigns in 2014 Tripartite Elections not led to 90% registration of eligible voters ( which was a record in the country) but also led to an average of 70% voter turnout and reduced the number of null and void votes to slightly above 1% from about 4.5 % in previous elections. Furthermore, NICE provided monitors to each of the polling centres in the above mentioned elections as well as issued pre- and post-elections messages both on radio and media outlets on the need to go and vote as well as importance of peaceful co-existence.
